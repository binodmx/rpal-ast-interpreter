# rpal-ast-interpreter
(Abstract Syntax Tree interpreter for the RPAL functional language)

RPAL (Right-reference Pedagogic Algorithmic Language) is a functional language where only expressions are used to develop a program. RPAL has no concept of ‘‘assignment’’, nor even one of ‘‘memory’’. There are no loops, only recursion. RPAL is a dynamically typed language. An interpreter is needed to run a RPAL program. rpal-ast-interpreter is an intermediate program developed using java programming language that can interpret the abstract syntax tree of a RPAL program.
